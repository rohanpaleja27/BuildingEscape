# BuildingEscape
Building Escape Game Created with the Unreal Engine


## Getting Started
_____________________________

### Installing

If you would like to clone my repo to expand upon the building escape game, or play upon it in unreal
run,

`git clone https://github.com/rohanpaleja27/BuildingEscape`

from the terminal.

If you would just like to play the game, please download the .exe file from my GitHub page.

### Controls

Basic Controls

Control Key | Purpose|
--- | --- |
`right mouse click` | **Pick Up Object**|
`let go right mouse click` | **Drop Object**|
`Up` | **Move Forward**|
`Left` | **Move Left**|
`Down` | **Move Back**|
`Right` | **Move Right**|


### Bugs

There are some slight bugs. 

* You have to be looking down at the object to pick it up.

* If you drop an object and get stuck under, move back.

* If you drop an object and it falls, you can try to place it upright again but it may be easier to restart.

* No menu screen, so as soon as you open up the executable, you are in the game.

* Once you escape the room, you fall to your death.
